## Thoughts

I found a couple nice new resources from this project. [Radnomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) which is a way to generate random people really easily. Another one is the [Animate on Scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library. I really need to start trying to use more libraries like this in my projects. There are too many times I try to do something by hand when I could probably just do a few lines from a library and make it 100 times easier.

This project was mostly about learning the Animate On Scroll library. I remember I had a past project I tried to do an animate on scroll on my own but couldn't figure it out. This library would have come in handy back then.
